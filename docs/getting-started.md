# Getting Started

## First Steps

1. Install `Python` [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) distribution and enable conda command prompt depending of your operative system.

2. Now, you can create a `Python 3.11` virtual environment with:

    ```bash
    conda create -n mtwp-py311 python=3.11.4 && conda activate mtwp-py311
    ```

3. Let's go!
